# Who am I?
Hello! My name is Liam and I currently do a few things. Time to time, I work on projects such as my Ruby project. I am apart of the JartexNetwork community, which I am sure most of you are, and this will be my introduction. I enjoy to code things, but I do not get a lot of time as I have other things to prioritise, meaning that I get a small amount done every so often.

## What am I working on?
As previously said, I am currently working on a Ruby project. This project is not known to the community yet however I am working alongside with 2 Developers as well as another player from JartexNetwork who will be there to assist in managing the project as it is community based. We are excited to release this into the community!

I plan to work on a few other ideas, all of them Minecraft related, however they are now high priorities at the moment.

### What are you studying?
I am currently attending college for "Creative Technology", which teaches us about IT as well as how the online world works. We learn things about databases, website development, program development, maintaining hardware as well as fixing computers in general. 

### How do I reach you?
As you may notice, my Discord messages are indeed off. If you have a JartexNetwork question, and it is to do with Jartex's management side of things, feel free to email support@jartexnetwork.com however I will be conducting a method of communication shortly, so please do be patient! In the mean time, simply tag me in main chat with your topic, if you simply tag me, I may not reply so make sure to provide your topic there.

That is all! I may add more here later on. This just seemed like a nice idea to do, to customize my GitHub page, and I stole the idea off Nuggets.
